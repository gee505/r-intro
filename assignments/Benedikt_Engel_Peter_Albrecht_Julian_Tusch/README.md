During the COVID-19 pandemic, people in the U.S. faced severe restrictions on their social lives. The frequency of interactions with friends and family decreased, and activities such as dating or even grocery shopping were significantly impacted. To understand how these restrictions affected consumer spending, we will examine spending patterns on Valentine's Day to determine whether the pandemic led to increased spending. Additionally, we will analyze the most popular gifts and explore how age influences both the types of gifts purchased and the amount spent on Valentine's Day over a 12-year period (2010â€“2022).

For this research project we made use of the following datasets:

- [COVID-19 cases in 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-usa)

- [Spending behaviour on Valentines day](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2024/2024-02-13/readme.md)

All data was collected exclusively in the USA.
